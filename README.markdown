# Personal Portfolio Page

Viewable at [this link](https://sam-jdnz2018.github.io/personal-portfolio-project/).

A portfolio page covering the other four projects within the FreeCodeCamp 'Responsive Web Design Projects' category. My interpretation of the 'Personal Portfolio' project from FreeCodeCamp. Brought into GitHub from CodePen where it was originally created.
